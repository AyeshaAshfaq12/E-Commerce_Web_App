# Spare-Parts Management Web App  

### Course: **CS-165L SE**  

## **Project Descripti**on:

The problem is the need for a web app to manage spare parts effectively. The goal is to create an online platform for a spare parts broker that can efficiently handle inventory, and customer orders, and provide valuable business insights. This solution requires an admin interface to request quotes from different vendors, compare them, place orders, track order statuses, and facilitate the shipping of goods to importing countries. Additionally, there’s a requirement for a financial ledger to keep logs of the manufacturer’s account.
